# Plate-recognition-based-on-IoT
the project is about sending a specific plate number over mqtt from a node mcu to the pc.
the pc receives the plate number and then search in the dataset untill it find it.
after finding the plate we send back to the node mcu that the plate is founded.

in the plate detection we have used YOLOv4.
for the YOLOv4 dataset i used the dataset in here.

# monitoring the data over hivemq
# receiving the plate nember we want to find
# searching for the plate
